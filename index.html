		<p data-view-type="course">Digital imaging techniques are becoming a fast growing method for microstructural characterization. Since there is a crucial

		<h1> Visible light: </h1>
		<p> Microscopy: allows looking at objects not visible for the naked eye.</p>
		<p>Limitation: the smallest distinguishable features are determined by the wavelength of visual light (0.4 - 0.7 μm)</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Microscopy has always been an intriguing area of science, since it allows looking at objects in a way which is beyond the
			possibilities of the naked eye. From the end of the 16th century, optical lenses were used to magnify objects more than
			a hundredfold, which opened a whole new world to scientists of all fields. Although modern optical microscopes make it
			possible to look at matter at the microscopic scale, there is also a limit. The smallest distinguishable features are
			determined by the wavelength of visual light (±0.4 - 0.7 μm), due to the fact that even a microscope with perfect lenses
			is subjected to diffractive effects. However, by changing the source of illumination to a radiation probe with a smaller
			wavelength, smaller details can be observed.</p>

		<p data-view-type="course">Figure 1 gives an overview of various types of electromagnetic radiation and corresponding real world objects with a size

		<p data-view-type="course">In electron microscopes, a high voltage is used to accelerate electrons emitted from a heated filament, which can then
			be focused using magnetic lenses onto a sample. The resolution in these devices is limited by the lenses.</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">One issue which is common to both microscopic techniques is the need for sample preparation. Because of the limited penetrating
			power of both visible light and electrons, thin slices of the sample have to be produced to investigate the sample in
			transmission (the amount of transmission through the sample gives information about the composition). It is also possible
			to study objects by detecting reflected light/particles, but even then some kind of sample preparation (like polishing)
			is often needed. In both modes, no true 3D information can be obtained (only slices or surfaces are visualised). Furthermore,
			these methods are often destructive, making it impossible to perform other analytical techniques on the same sample afterwards.</p>

		<p> X-rays typically have a wavelength below 10 nm => in practice resolution is limited because of other reasons (focusing

		<p data-view-type="course">X-rays are an alternative probe to study small objects. As can be seen in Figure 1, X-rays typically have a wavelength
			below 10 nm, which means that in practice the resolution is limited because of other reasons (focusing devices). Another
			important fact about X-rays is that they are attenuated less easily than electrons and visible light. More importantly,
			their penetrating power is largely dependent on their energy (which is directly related to their wavelength), making it
			possible to adjust the energy of the source to the type of sample under investigation (based on size, composition,...).</p>

		<h1>Some general terms:</h1>

			<li>Mesostructure: those features that are on the borderline of the visible.</li>
			<li>Microstructure: covers the scale of structural phenomena most commonly of concern to geologists, namely grain and particle
				size, microcracking and microporosity.
			</li>
			<li>Nanostructure: restricted to sub-micrometre features including the width of grain boundaries. A nanostructure is an object

		</ul>
		<p data-view-type="course">Since “microstructure” is a very general term, used to cover a wide range of structural features from those visible to

		<p data-view-type="course">During this course, several techniques including the analysis of digital thin sections (largely based on the book of John
			Russ “The imaging processing handbook”) obtained by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy techniques, X-ray
			CT, neutron CT and XRF will be discussed.</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">A high quality petrographical microscope can usefully magnify up to 600 times with a maximum resolution of around 1 µm.
			Where closer examination is required, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is invaluable as it achieves significantly higher
			magnifications up to 50.000 times and resolutions of around 7 nm, by using a beam of high-energy electrons to replace
			the light of conventional microscopes. In addition to their high-resolution capabilities, electron microscopes have great
			depth of field, producing electron images that have a 3D effect. By combining SEM with an electron probe microanalysis
			system (EPM) elemental chemical analysis of characteristic X-ray spectra emitted by the sample can be performed. By performing
			“spot” analysis on selected points of the sample, a semi-quantitative elemental analysis can be performed, while “elemental
			mapping” scans along a square line raster over a larger area of the sample surface allow the observation of variations
			in elemental distributions.</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">Mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) can also be useful for identification of crystalline minerals when the
			optical properties do not allow definitive microscopical identification. XRD (which is not in the scope of this course)
			has the advantage of actually identifying the minerals present, although estimation of the relative amounts is semi-quantitative.
			Other spectroscopic analysis methods such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), atomic absorption (AAS), and inductively coupled
			plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) give very precise determinations of elemental composition. However, the
			elemental composition data from these techniques require skilled interpretation by the analyst to identify the proportions
			of mineral phases present.</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the emission of characteristic "secondary" (or fluorescent) X-rays from a material that has
			been excited by bombarding with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays. The phenomenon is widely used for chemical analysis.
			Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements
			employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry, the
			technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element in a sample to be analyzed. Inductively coupled
			plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
			(ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that
			uses the inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths
			characteristic of a particular element (Stefánsson et al., 2007). The intensity of this emission is indicative of the
			concentration of the element within the sample.</p>
		<p data-view-type="course">High-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) or micro-CT (µCT) is a frequently used non-destructive 3D imaging and
			analysis technique for the investigation of internal structures of a large variety of objects, including geomaterials.
			One of the main advantages of this technique is the fact that it is a non-destructive characterization technique which
			allows 4D monitoring of internal structural changes at resolutions down to a few hundred nanometres. X-ray CT, just like
			XRF, can be performed both in laboratory environment or at synchrotron facilities. Neutron CT is a form of computed tomography
			involving the production of three-dimensional images by the detection of the absorbance of neutrons produced by a neutron
			source. It creates a three-dimensional image of an object by combining multiple planar images with a known separation
			just like X-ray CT. Whilst its resolution is lower than that of X-ray tomography, it can be useful for specimens containing
			low contrast between the matrix and object of interest; for instance, fossils with a high carbon content, such as plants
			or vertebrate remains or water inside stone. However, neutron tomography can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving
			imaged samples radioactive.</p>

		<p data-view-type="course">CALIBRATION: With computer analysis of digital images taken at the microscope, the images are represented in the form of
			picture elements, or pixels, which are small dots making up the image. In order to perform measurements, the image analysis
			tools need to know how many pixels there are in one unit length of the image. The unit length may be in millimeters, micrometers,
			or any other unit chosen according to the overall size of the image and its important components. The process of assigning
			the number of pixels per unit length to an image is known as calibration. Before undertaking any analysis, a system setup
			must be calibrated so that measurements such as length, perimeter, or area are calculated in a specific unit, rather than
			as number of pixels measured (Reedy and Kamboj 2004). The calibration for each setup depends on the magnification of the
			objective lens that is used to view the image under the microscope, the resolution under which the image is stored, and
			the digital camera/microscope combination that is being used to acquire the image. This calibration measure will then
			apply to all images taken with that combination. The appropriate calibration measure must be imported and applied to each
			image at the time of analysis, so it is crucial to store that information on the image itself, in the filename, or in
			an image database. Most digital microscope cameras include the capability of marking each image directly at the time of
			image capture with a scale bar. Where this was not done, a scale bar can be inserted after the fact with most image analysis
			software packages. It is important to include the scale bar in published reports rather than listing a magnification.
			Calculated magnifications apply to what the eye sees when looking into the microscope lens. In traditional work, magnifications
			had to be recalculated to adjust for publication size of photomicrographs. In image analysis work there are also many
			intermediate steps in which the digital image may be resized, which also would affect magnification. The original image
			as viewed under the microscope can be thought of as a rubber band being extended or contracted during photography, analysis,
			and final publication, making magnifications impossible to track. Thus most journals require scale bars in thin-section
			images, but do not list magnifications.</p>

			routines can be set up to perform image enhancement or preprocessing steps automatically. One often needs to separate
			two or more different particle types, phases, or components, and then count or measure specific features of one or both
			populations. Before any measurement and analysis can be done, particles must be clearly visible, with high contrast between
			particles and matrix or between the components of interest. There are a variety of approaches to preprocessing to correct
			potential problems. For example, image contrast and brightness can be manipulated to emphasize particular features, and
			various algorithms can be applied such as an edge enhancement filter that highlights all edges and ignores particle masses
			(Schmitt 1993; Goins and Reedy 2000). Most comprehensive image analysis packages include all tools needed for preprocessing.
			For many thin sections, contrast enhancement is sufficient to improve the image enough for successful analysis. Some initial
